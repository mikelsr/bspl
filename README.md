**Blindingly Simple Protocol Language ([BSPL](https://confluence.oceanobservatories.org/download/attachments/28809860/AAMAS-11-IBIOP.pdf))** Go parser
and implementation interfacing for [nahs](https://github.com/mikelsr/nahs).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mikelsr/bspl.svg?token=736yMuj6XUy7yCEvSpBB&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mikelsr/bspl)

The parser (module `parser`) can be used as a standalone parser. It was implemented using [a toy lexer](https://github.com/mikelsr/gauzaez) I wrote a while ago.

The interfaces are the ones I used for another project.
