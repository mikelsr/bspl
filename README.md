**Blindingly Simple Protocol Language ([BSPL](https://confluence.oceanobservatories.org/download/attachments/28809860/AAMAS-11-IBIOP.pdf))** Go parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mikelsr/bspl.svg?token=736yMuj6XUy7yCEvSpBB&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mikelsr/bspl)

Implemented using [a lexer](https://github.com/mikelsr/gauzaez) I created years
ago while learning about finite automatons.

## What does it do

* Read a protocol described with BSPL and produce a Go structure with that description

## What doesn't it do

 * Anything than isn't reading a protocol described with BSPL and producing a Go structure with that description, like checking the validity of the protocol
